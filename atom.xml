        <content type="html"><![CDATA[This blogpost introduces the event-driven predictions addon and is the third of my series of event-driven with Kogito posts, after the and event-driven predictions addons.  It is available since Kogito v1.12.0 and its behavior resembles what the previous two addons already do for decisions and rules.   KEY CONCEPTS  The new addon enables the evaluation of PMML models in an event-driven fashion, so that it can be used as part of an event processing pipeline.  Like the other addons, it comes in two flavours: Quarkus and Spring Boot, and, in order to use it, the developer only needs to include the correct version as dependency of his Kogito app and configure it. The Kogito code-generation and framework specific CDI are then leveraged to do the wiring.  The execution is triggered upon receiving an event containing the input parameters in a specified Kafka topic. The result is then sent to a Kafka output topic (which may be the same). Both input and output events are formatted as .  It is implemented to behave like the REST endpoints: the model executor can be configured via a dedicated flag to either receive only the main output parameter(s) or the full PMML result in the output event.   EVENT STRUCTURE   INPUT EVENT  A model evaluation is triggered by a specific event called PredictionRequest.  Here is the list of the supported field, including the optional ones:  FieldPurposeMandatoryDefaultdataInput parametersyesidCloudEvent IDyeskogitopmmlfullresultBoolean flag to enable/disable receiving full PMML result as outputnofalsekogitopmmlmodelnameName of PMML model to evaluateyessourceCloudEvent sourceyesspecversionMust be equal to 1.0 as mandated by CloudEvent specificationyessubjectIf specified, the engine will put the same value as subject of the output event. Its usage is up to the caller (e.g. as correlation ID).nonulltypeMust be equal to PredictionRequestyes  EXAMPLE OF PREDICTIONREQUEST EVENT   {   "specversion": "1.0",   "id": "a89b61a2-5644-487a-8a86-144855c5dce8",   "source": "SomeEventSource",   "type": "PredictionRequest",   "subject": "TheSubject",   "kogitopmmlmodelname": "PredicatesMining",   "data": {     "residenceState": "AP",     "validLicense": true,     "occupation": "ASTRONAUT",     "categoricalY": "classA",     "categoricalX": "red",     "variable": 6.6,     "age": 25.0   } }    OUTPUT EVENTS  If the request is evaluated successfully, the system returns two different types of output events depending on the value of the kogitopmmlfullresult flag:   * PredictionResponse if only the main output parameters are returned  * PredictionResponseFull if the full PMML result is returned  The results are always in the data field.  EXAMPLE OF PREDICTIONRESPONSE EVENT   {   "specversion": "1.0",   "id": "d54ace84-6788-46b6-a359-b308f8b21778",   "source": "PredicatesMining",   "type": "PredictionResponse",   "subject": "TheSubject",   "kogitopmmlmodelname": "PredicatesMining",   "data": {     "categoricalResult": 1.381666666666666   } }   EXAMPLE OF PREDICTIONRESPONSEFULL EVENT   {   "specversion": "1.0",   "id": "d54ace84-6788-46b6-a359-b308f8b21778",   "source": "PredicatesMining",   "type": "PredictionResponseFull",   "subject": "TheSubject",   "kogitopmmlmodelname": "PredicatesMining",   "data": {     "segmentIndex": 0,     "resultCode": "OK",     "resultObjectName": "categoricalResult",     "resultVariables": {       "categoricalResult": 1.381666666666666     }   } }    ERROR EVENTS  If, for some reason, the request event is malformed or contains wrong information so that the evaluation can’t be triggered, a PredictionResponseError is sent as output.  In this case the data field contains a string that specifies the error type:  Error TypeMeaningBAD_REQUESTMalformed input event (e.g. when some mandatory fields are missing)MODEL_NOT_FOUNDThe specified PMML model can’t be found in the current service   EXAMPLES  The Kogito Examples repository contains two examples, and , that you can use as a starting point to practice with this addon.  They also contain tests for every possible variation in the structure of the input/output events supported by the addon in the src/test/resources/events subfolder.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is designed to catch the crucial business logic which affects decisions. It’s not meant to be a replacement for a general purpose programming language. FEEL is a powerful expression, but it is on purpose designed to be an expression language and not an imperative language to avoid bringing in the DMN unnecessary complexities which should be addressed somewhere else.  For example, the "french amortization method" is widely used in the financial industry, however it does not make a lot of sense to implement it in DMN.  Why not? Because, it’s a fixed algorithm not subject to change, the implementation is already available somewhere else and more importantly business users don’t want to change that logic. Whereas, It’s likely that business users want to adjust the algorithm parameters based on the customer features: eventually, this part of the logic is eligible to be designed in a DMN.  In short, at the design stage you have to decide what you need to implement in Java (or another language) and what you need to implement in DMN. The input data of a decision can be pre-processed by an application logic, the same applies to the output data which can be enriched or used by a complex algorithm.  In some cases, complex data manipulation may be required within a decision, which is difficult to implement in FEEL but easy to write in Java.  Inside DMN, you can call a static method of a Java class. The Function call can happen inside a Context or in Business Knowledge Model, in essence:   1. Click in the corner and switch from FEEL to JAVA  Select Java  2. Define the Fully Qualified Name of the Java Class     3. Define the method signature.        4. Define the parameter list. Here the final outcome: Java function Pay           attention: in Java a string is a class, so you have to type the fully           qualified name: java.lang.String. In the following video, a step by           step tutorial using Kogito DMN:                                            REFERENCES                      *            *            *            *   The post appeared first on .  ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 4 - Example HL7 & FHIR integration  In our  from this series we talked about the example iDaaS data architecture which outlines at a higher abstraction level the solution for any healthcare organisation.       The process was laid out how we approached the use case and how portfolio solutions are the base for researching a generic architecture. It continued by laying out the process of how we approached the use case by researching successful customer portfolio solutions as the basis for a generic architecture.  Having completed our discussions on the example data integration architecture, we'll walk you through a more specific example. This scenario is showing a proven and scalable architecture for integrating HL7 and FHIR solutions into your healthcare organisation.     ARCHITECTURE REVIEW  As mentioned before, the architectural details covered here are based on real solutions using open source technologies. The example scenario presented here is a generic common architecture that was uncovered while researching those solutions. It's our intent to provide guidance and not deep technical details.  This section covers the visual representations as presented, but it's expected that they'll be evolving based on future research. There are many ways to represent each element in this architecture, but we've chosen a format that we hope makes it easy to absorb. Feel free to post comments at the bottom of this post, or  with your feedback.  Now let's take a look at the details in this architecture and outline the solution.     IDAAS HL7 AND FHIR INTEGRATION  In the previous article, details were given for a general overview of the data integration architecture for iDaaS. In this example the goal is not focus more on the collection of iDaaS Connect integration services and how they are specifically architected to integrate HL7 and FHIR systems in a healthcare organisation.  With that in mind, let's starting on the left side of the diagram where the entry point for actors in this architecture can be found. They're representing the edge devices as well as the users submitting requests and receiving responses.  These users are representing patients, vendors, suppliers, and clinical personnel. The administrators is representing the clinical personnel tasked with managing the various healthcare processes.  All requests enter through the API management element, used to secure and authenticate access to internal services and applications. The first collection of elements encountered is labeled as iDaaS Connect, where we find all the various integration services for specific communication channels as discussed in the previous article.   Specific to this example, the figure narrows the scope of iDaaS Connect to just those required for HL7 and FHIR integration scenarios. Two elements are shown and each one is a specific collection of microservices implementing their respective communication standards. The HL7 connect microservices element provides connectivity to systems and organisations that have adopted this specific healthcare standard. A FHIR connect microservices element does the same for that healthcare standard. Backing both of these elements is a message transformation microservices element. This is used to ensure messages are in the formats needed for the eventual backend events that need to take place when they come into the architecture, or translated back out to the right standard for the end point consumer.   After all of the standards integration and eventual message transformation activities, iDaaS Connect services register events (and receive event notification from) the iDaaS connect events. This is a central hub that ensures all events are registered, managed, and notifications are sent to the appropriate elements in the iDaaS architecture.   Events will often trigger elements of the iDaaS DREAM collection to take action, through the iDaaS event builder which captures business automation activities and the iDaaS intelligent data router. This data router is capable of managing where specific data needs to be sent, both inbound to sources and outbound to application or service destinations. It's assisted by the iDaaS connect data distribution element which ensures integration with all manner of data sources which might be in local or remote locations such as a public cloud. There are all manner of possible, and optional, external services that a healthcare organisation might integrate from third-party or externally hosted services such as reporting services, security, analytics, monitoring & logging, external API management, big data, and other partner data services.  Finally, the iDaaS generic architecture provides both conformance and insights into the knowledge being managed by the offered solutions. For simplicity these elements were left out of this specific architecture diagram.  Next up, a look at the architectural solution with a focus on the data view.     IDAAS HL7 AND FHIR INTEGRATION (DATA)  Data connectivity through the iDaaS connect HL7 and FHIR integration architecture provides a different look at the architecture and gives us insights into how one of the most valuable assets of a healthcare organisation is being processed.  It should be seen as the architecture is intended, as a guide and not a definitive must-do-it-this-way statement on how the data is being routed through as actors are engaging with the systems, applications, and services in this architecture.  Note that many of the data flows only one direction while it's fairly obvious it's going to flow both ways. We've chosen to note that in the flows that do not disrupt the clarity of the architecture diagram, and chose not to indicate where the intent is to show processing and flows for clarity from actors to systems on the backend.  It's left to the reader to explore these data diagrams and feel free to send comments our way.   WHAT'S NEXT  This was just a short overview of an example HL7 and FHIR integration architecture for the intelligent data as a service architecture.   An overview of this series on intelligent data as a service architecture:   1.   2.   3.   4.   5. Example data insights  Catch up on any articles you missed by following one of the links above.  Next in this series, taking a look at a more specific architectural example of iDaaS data insights that can be mapped to your own intelligent data as a service solutions.  ]]></content>

        <updated>2022-01-21T11:12:09.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In this post I want to share an interesting use case of data enrichment, using DMN with BPMN and other open standards.  The typical usage pattern for data enrichment is the following: a complex data structure containing several attributes is provided as input; based on some computations and decision results, the original structure is enriched with additional attributes. In an even more complex scenario, already existing specific attributes are overridden with new values.  Often this usage pattern is referred to as “mutability”, but speaking about mutability is an improper terminology to be used in the context of DMN; DMN is stateless and mandates that “all decision logic is free of side-effects” (DMN Specification chapter 5.2.3) among other idempotent and deterministic requirements.  Instead a more important aspect to focus on, while considering this use-case, is that Functional Programming has taught us powerful lessons which can be applied in this context: we can achieve the desired goal by pushing side-effects at the boundaries, or by adopting other FP strategies.  In this post we will see how we don’t strictly need mutability features, in order to effectively achieve data enrichment.  I will demonstrate the pragmatic implementation of this use-case, both by using DMN as a standalone knowledge asset, as well as combining the same DMN model with a BPMN process.   INTRODUCTION  For the remainder of this post, we will use a running example where the fundamental Domain Model is a structure dealing with an incoming request of Tech Support.  This can be represented as a DMN ItemDefinition, shown in the screenshot below; we can also use the idiomatic Java Pojo representation, following the Kie v7 conventions:  For this example, we can notice most attributes are pertaining to the event of the support request being raised:    "Support Request" : {     "full name" : "John Doe",     "email" : "info@redhat.com",     "mobile" : "+1",     "mailing address" : "somewhere",     "account" : "47",     "premium" : false,     "area" : "tech",     "description" : "app crashed"   }  all except for the priority attribute.  The goal of the business application is to process the support request, establish the appropriate priority level, and then produce a support request with the priority attribute now correctly valorized.  While looking in details at this example, I will keep the decision logic simple and we will not use any complex decision logic to actually determine the priority value; as mentioned, the focus of this post is the processing of the incoming payload, to produce a fully valorized support request, also including the actual priority value.   STRATEGY A: COMBINE DMN WITH BPMN  A first approach is to combine DMN and BPMN for the best of both worlds: DMN should focus on the decision logic keeping an immutable and stateless approach, while BPMN is used to manage in a stateful manner the different stages of processing for the support request.  The DMN model can focus on the decision logic to establish the appropriate Priority value, depending on the content of the incoming support request:  The current decision logic in the example right now is quite simplistic because as mentioned is not the most important aspect, but naturally can be further extended to have a more complex decision table, etc:  Now we need to have as output almost the ~same structure we have received as input, and override it with the combination of the key-value pair for Priority, having value either “High” or “Medium”.  We can use for this goal a BPMN process:  The process is started by receiving as input the support request payload, stored as a process variable named “request”.  The first BPMN Task, named “Process Support Request”, is in charge of:   1. Invoke the evaluation of the DMN model, passing the incoming support request     (the “request” process variable) as input of the DMN evaluation.  2. Take the output decision of the DMN evaluation, “Determine Priority”, and     assign it to a temporary process variable called “priority”.  3. Modify the “request” process variable, with the value now contained in the     “priority” from step2.  You can find more details about these three steps of the “Process Support Request” Task in the next section.  Later, the “request” process variable is will be fully valorized as well in the priority attribute, so that can be used in the gateway, as one would naturally expect:  This has achieved the original requirements.   DETAILS  The final step 3 of the “Process Support Request” BPMN Task in effect mutates the original structure; however, it is important to be noted that the mutation happens indeed in the context of a BPMN process, which naturally allows for statefulness, mutations, side-effects, etc.  In this strategy, we have kept the DMN model fully focused on the actual decision, that is the determination of the priority for the given support request.  Currently this is implemented on jBPM Kie v7 with the three steps described above, meaning it can be achieved already today by:  Input “Support Request” <- request (process variable) Output “Determine Priority” -> priority (process variable)  Please notice in the screenshot both the assignment in the foreground to a temporary process variable name “priority” (step2) and in the background the modification of the support request in the attribute “priority” using the On Exit Action script (step3).  Step2 and Step3 of the “Process Support Request” Task, in the future, could be combined in the Data Assignment, directly in the Task’s “Data I/O”, when support for expressions will be fully implemented.  Something that could potentially look like this:  Input “Support Request” <- request (process variable) Output “Determine Priority” -> ${request.priority} (expression)  Support for expressions is currently being discussed for FEEL in future iterations and might achieve something similar.   STRATEGY B: USING DMN STANDALONE  Another approach is to use DMN only; in this case we cannot modify the original InputData value, but we can definitely create an exact copy of the input payload structure but altered only on the desired attribute “priority”.  Naturally we want to do this without having to replicate manually all the original attributes, which would be extremely tedious!   NOTE: this approach is still fully compliant with the DMN Specification semantics, meaning free of side-effects and stateless.   We introduce a new built-in function called “context put”: this function takes 3 parameters:   * “context” of type context (a composite structure in DMN terms)  * “key” of type string  * “value” of Any type  and produces a resulting context altered in the key-value pair, or enriched of the new key-value pair.  For example:  context put({ name: "John Doe" }, "age", 47)  would result in:  { name: "John Doe", age: 47 }  You might have some ideas by now about where this is about to go 🙂  We can achieve something similar to:  context put( <request> , "priority", ... )  This in fact it is pretty easy, by taking the previous DMN model and adding just one more Decision to keep the clarity of the decision logics in the DRG:  In this DRD picture I’ve used the same colour to highlight both nodes “Support Request” and “Processed Request” having the same typeRef, meaning both nodes conform to the ItemDefinition “tSupportRequest” originally shown at the beginning of this post.  The decision logic for “Processed Request” is super simple, meaning:  As we have learnt, that means: produce the same structure of the node “Support Request” but altered (or appended) with a new key-value pair, having key “priority” and having value from the “Determine Priority” sub-decision.  So we have achieved the same goal, following another strategy now; we have as output Decision the same structure we see in one of the InputData, but valorized in the new “priority” attribute value!  This would also work in a totally equivalent BPMN process too:  This BPMN process is now simpler in the Task’s Data I/O Assignments, as we no longer need the previously required Step2+Step3.  The BPMN "Process Support Request" Task now simply uses:  Input “Support Request” <- request (process variable) Output “Processed Request” -> request (process variable)  This works perfectly thanks to the awesome contributions by Anton Giertli clarifying requirements and work by Enrique Gonzalez Martinez with , allowing a better integration of the DMN results with the jBPM’s BRE Task!    DETAILS  Adopting the same JSON originally presented at the beginning of this post, we can use that as a DMN input payload and check the results using this DMN model alone.  DMNContext of INPUT:  {   "Support Request" : {     "account" : "47",     "email" : "info@redhat.com",     "mobile" : "+1",     "premium" : false,     "area" : "tech",     "description" : "app crashed",     "priority" : null,     "full name" : "John Doe",     "mailing address" : "somewhere"   } }  DMNResult of OUTPUT:  {   "Support Request" : {     "account" : "47",     "email" : "info@redhat.com",     "mobile" : "+1",     "premium" : false,     "area" : "tech",     "description" : "app crashed",     "priority" : null,     "full name" : "John Doe",     "mailing address" : "somewhere"   },   "Determine Priority" : "Medium",   "Processed Request" : {     "area" : "tech",     "premium" : false,     "mobile" : "+1",     "description" : "app crashed",     "mailing address" : "somewhere",     "full name" : "John Doe",     "priority" : "Medium",     "account" : "47",     "email" : "info@redhat.com"   } }  This "context put" function is not part of the DMN v1.3 specification, so at the time of writing this is to be considered an experimental and extended built-in function, even if it is actually provided as part of the Drools DMN Engine out of the box. The DMN Revision Task Force group might decide to eventually adopt this in a future release of the specification. In fact, this blog post takes inspiration from drawing additional consequences after a Vendor proposal raised similar use-case in the DMN RTF Group: I believe this is a very encouraging demonstration of the power of open standards and their communities, where innovations are generated by the collaboration of different Vendors! Previously, we have been internally experimenting with a similar concept called “lambda-update(object,[fields])”, but the ultimate approach presented with this post is much simpler.  In the meantime of that final DMN approval, the usage of this extended built-in function is to be considered experimental.  The DMNContext in the dmn output results contains as expected the two structures, and they both conform to the ItemDefinition defining the content of said structure, as expected. On the Drools DMN Engine Java API however as we have learnt, they are not the same instances and they are not necessarily the same Java class: it could be the case the input is supplied as a Pojo and the output resulting as a java.util.Map, or it could also work by having a java.util.Map as input and again as output. Naturally in any case, either the Pojo or either the java.util.Map must conform (or do conform automatically when produced by the engine) to the applicable ItemDefinition(s), meaning they include all the properties expected from the ItemDefinition’s components. This is an implementation detail of the embedded Java API, and it is completely transparent when dealing with REST APIs, such as those code generated on a Kogito based application, or by leveraging the Kie Server’s “Next generation DMN model specific endpoints” (). This is also completely transparent when integrating DMN inside a jBPM BRE Task, as mentioned thanks to the improvement of ().  The same decision logic for the new Decision node could have equivalently be expressed with a boxed function invocation too:  The same DMN model would indeed code generate the expected REST API endpoint definitions on a Kogito based application too:  We can notice the payload structure both in Request and Response of the Swagger / OpenAPI is the expected one.   WHAT ABOUT DATA TRANSFORMATION?  This example naturally draws even closer to additional use-cases which can be integrated in the context of DMN implementation, such as data transformation.  The power of DMN can be fully exploited when using its notation to describe business rules and decision logic, and while it can be also employed to “transform” data in a way similarly described in this post, using DMN purely for data transformation may not always be the best solution. For the use-case dealing only with pure data transformation requirements, we suggest you also take a look at , a data mapping solution with interactive web based user interface.   CONCLUSIONS  We have learnt how to leverage open standards in the best possible way to achieve the desired goals, even better by considering two very pragmatic strategies:   * Combine DMN with the power of BPMN  * Use DMN standalone and an extended feature  We have also seen how integrations and collaborations are foundational elements which allowed us to achieve these important results!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In my post last September, I tried to give a sense of how the transition to Jakarta EE 10 was likely to impact the next few WildFly releases. With out the door and our efforts for 2022 ramping up, I want to give our community on update on how we see things playing out over the course of the year.  The tl;dr; of this is WildFly will be moving away from time-boxed major feature releases for 2022, and will instead produce feature-boxed majors when key feature sets like EE 10 are ready. We do, however, want to produce updates for our community, so in the March timeframe we’ll be doing a WildFly 26.1 release.  Before I get into the details, first a bit of explanation of how the WildFly project operates.   CURRENT WILDFLY DEVELOPMENT AND RELEASE PRACTICES  Since the WildFly 12 release, the WildFly project has followed a roughly time-boxed development model. Roughly every three months we endeavor to produce a new WildFly major release, with a large set of features, enhancements and bug fixes. We don’t operate on a strict time schedule, but we avoid significant schedule delays just to bring in particular feature or set of features. If a feature doesn’t make a particular release it can just go in the next one a few months later.  The vast majority of the work on WildFly, both for features and bug fixing, is on our main branch, aimed at producing the next WildFly major.  When we release each major we also create a new branch specific to that major. That branch is used to produce one micro (primarily bug fix) release for the major, with the micro usually released about a month after the major. This too is roughly time-boxed. We just . The number of changes in the micro is typically small compared to what’s gone into main in the same period, as we want to be particularly conservative about introducing bugs or behavior changes in the micro. We’ve been consistently producing these micros since WildFly 17.0.1, and had done a few prior to that as well.   MOVING TO FEATURE-BOXED DEVELOPMENT FOR 2022  Time-boxed releases work well most of the time but they can be problematic when a large interrelated set of features need to come in as a block. Say, for example, Jakarta EE 10! Trying to fit all of our EE 10 work into a single quarterly release is not looking practical, and using time boxing for EE 10 isn’t conceptually valid, as Jakarta’s work on EE 10 itself isn’t time-boxed.  So, we’ve decided to make WildFly 27 feature-boxed, with EE 10 as the primary feature set. We’ll produce WildFly 27.0.0.Final when we are satisfied that we’ve met our feature goals. When that will be done is uncertain, partly because it depends on when EE 10 itself goes GA. For sure we won’t be done in March, when our next major normally would be released.  Typically for a WildFly major we produce a single feature-complete Beta release a couple weeks before the Final release. It’s likely that for 27 we’ll also produce at least one interim, not-feature-complete release, probably labeled as an Alpha.  I expect WildFly 28 will be feature-boxed as well. My instinct is once the EE 10 work is complete we’ll have a big enough further set of work that is best done as a unit to justify doing another feature boxed release.  Late in 2022 or early in 2023 I’d like for the project to move back to quarterly time boxing. I think most of the time that is the better way to deliver software.   WILDFLY 26.1  We don’t want to entirely move away from our quarterly feature releases though. We want to make some features available to our users without waiting for WildFly 27, and we want to have a vehicle for releasing some bug fixes. So, in the roughly March timeframe when we would have done our next feature release, we plan to release a WildFly 26.1. However, the feature and bug fix payload for this release will be significantly smaller than what would be included in a typical WildFly quarterly release. Our development efforts this quarter will largely be focused on WildFly 27.  We’ll also do a 26.1.1 release roughly a month after 26.1.0.  If it makes sense we may do a WildFly 27.1 as well, later this year.   MAJOR CHANGES COMING IN WILDFLY 27  When WildFly 27 is released there will be large changes compared to WildFly 26:   * We don’t plan to support Jakarta EE 8 in standard WildFly. The WildFly 26.1    releases will be the last that support EE 8.   * We don’t plan to support Java SE 8 in WildFly 27. The WildFly 26.1 releases    will be the last that support SE 8. WildFly 27 will require SE 11 or later.   * We don’t plan to support MicroProfile 4.1 in WildFly 27. The WildFly 26.1    releases will be the last that support MicroProfile 4.1.   * We will likely . With all the other major changes coming in 27, it seems like    the right time to stop providing Log4j 1, and just have users who need it    package it in their deployments.  So, the WildFly 26.1 release will be the last feature release that support EE 8 and SE 8. With WildFly 27 we’ll have moved on to EE 10, SE 11/17 and MicroProfile 5.  We plan to continue to produce WildFly Preview. The primary use case for it at its inception was as a preview of our EE 9+ support, but from the start it was meant to be a general purpose way of providing a look at things not yet appropriate for standard WildFly, and there’s still a need for that. It wouldn’t surprise me though if the difference between WildFly 27 and WildFly Preview 27 is fairly small, while we focus our energies on completing EE 10.  We’re also strongly considered no longer producing the "Servlet-only distribution" of WildFly that can be found on for each WildFly release. We don’t see much evidence of this distribution being used, Galleon can easily be used to provision an equivalent server, and producing that distribution requires a non-trivial amount of work that could that could be applied elsewhere. I’d like to hear from the WildFly community about this, so I started a .   QUESTIONS?  If you have questions or want to provide feedback, I encourage you to post on the , on the or in . I will be starting threads on the forum and wildfly-dev list about this topic.  Best regards,  Brian]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[(Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscalers) is a fantastic project (currently incubating) that provides Kubernetes-based autoscalers to help applications to scale out according to the number of incoming events when they are listening to several kinds of event sources. In Camel K we’ve long supported for providing a similar functionality for integrations that are triggered by HTTP calls, so supporting KEDA was something planned since long time, because it enables full autoscaling from a wider collection of sources. The KEDA integration has now been merged and it will be available in Camel K 1.8.0. This post highlights some details of the solution. If you want to see it in action, you can just jump to the end to see the .   WHY KEDA AND CAMEL K?  Users may want to set up integrations that automatically scale, e.g. depending on the number of messages left in a Kafka topic (for their consumer group). The integration code may do e.g. transformations, aggregations and send data do a destination and it would be great if the number of instances deployed to a Kubernetes cluster could increase when there’s work left behind, or they can scale to zero when there’s no more data in the topic. This is what KEDA does by itself with scalers (Kafka is ). What you have now is that KEDA is now automatically configured by Camel K when you run integrations, so you get the autoscaling features out of the box (you just need to turn a flag on).   HOW DOES IT WORK?  In Camel K 1.8.0 a new has been introduced. The trait allows to manually tweak the KEDA configuration to make sure that some ScaledObjects (KEDA concept) are generated as part of the Integration reconciliation, but this is mostly an internal detail. The interesting part about the KEDA trait is that it can recognize special KEDA markers in Kamelets and automatically create a KEDA valid configuration when those Kamelets are used as sources. So users can just use Kamelets to create bindings as usual and, if they enable a KEDA flag via an annotation, they get an event driven autoscaler automatically configured.  The Kamelet catalog embedded in next release () contains two Kamelets enhanced with KEDA metadata: aws-sqs-source and kafka-source. These are just two examples of the many Kamelets that can be augmented in the future. The metadata configuration system is open and Kamelets can be marked at any time to work with KEDA: this means that you don’t need to wait for a new Camel K release to enable KEDA on a different source and, more importantly, that you can mark your own Kamelets with KEDA metadata to enable autoscaling from your internal organization components.  The Kamelet developer guide contains a new section on , but essentially markers are used to map Kamelet properties into KEDA configuration options, so that when you provide a Kamelet configuration, the corresponding KEDA options can be generated from it (all the work is done under the cover by the Camel K operator).   A BINDING EXAMPLE  Before looking at the demo, here’s an example of autoscaling binding that you can create with the latest Camel K:  apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1 kind: KameletBinding metadata:   name: kafka-to-sink   annotations:     trait.camel.apache.org/keda.enabled: "true" spec:   source:     ref:       apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1       kind: Kamelet       name: kafka-source     properties:       bootstrapServers: "<-- bootstrap servers -->"       consumerGroup: my-group       topic: "<-- the topic -->"       user: "<-- user -->"       password: "<-- pwd -->"   sink:     # ...   You can notice that the only difference from a standard binding is the presence of the trait.camel.apache.org/keda.enabled=true annotation that enables the KEDA trait in Camel K. The information about how to map Kamelet properties into KEDA options is encoded in the Kamelet definition.   DEMO  Time for the demonstration. You’ll see both the aws-sqs-source and the kafka-source in action with Camel K and KEDA.  The code for the demo is in the repository on GitHub.   NEXT STEPS  There are many other Kamelets to enhance in and things to improve in Camel K that are listed in the section of the issue tracker.  Contributions are always welcome!]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our effort to make Kogito usable in an event-driven fashion, this article introduces a new addon: the event-driven rules addon.  It is available since Kogito v1.12.0 and its behavior resembles what the event-driven decisions addon () already does for decisions.   KEY CONCEPTS  The new addon enables the evaluation of DRL rule unit queries in an event-driven fashion, so that it can be used as part of an event processing pipeline.  Like the other addon, it comes in two flavours: Quarkus and Spring Boot, and, in order to use it, the developer only needs to include the correct version as dependency of his Kogito app and configure it. The Kogito code-generation and framework specific CDI are then leveraged to do the wiring.  The execution is triggered upon receiving an event containing the input facts in a specified Kafka topic. The result is then sent to a Kafka output topic (which may be the same). Both input and output events are formatted as .  It is implemented to behave like the REST endpoints: the output event contains the same output data the REST response would return if called with the same input facts.   EVENT STRUCTURE   INPUT EVENT  A model evaluation is triggered by a specific event called RulesRequest.  Here is the list of supported fields, including the optional ones:  FieldPurposeMandatoryDefaultdataInput factsyes–idCloudEvent IDyes–kogitoruleunitidID of the rule unit to evaluateyes–kogitoruleunitqueryName of the selected query belonging to the rule unityes–sourceCloudEvent sourceyes–specversionMust be equal to 1.0 as mandated by CloudEvent specificationyes–subjectIf specified, the engine will put the same value as the subject of the output event. Its usage is up to the caller (e.g. as correlation ID).nonulltypeMust be equal to RulesRequestyes–  EXAMPLE OF RULESREQUEST EVENT   {   "specversion": "1.0",   "id": "a89b61a2-5644-487a-8a86-144855c5dce8",   "source": "SomeEventSource",   "type": "RulesRequest",   "subject": "TheSubject",   "kogitoruleunitid": "org.kie.kogito.queries.LoanUnit",   "kogitoruleunitquery": "FindAllApplicationAmounts",   "data": {     "maxAmount": 5000,     "loanApplications": [       {         "id": "ABC10001",         "amount": 2000,         "deposit": 100,         "applicant": {           "age": 45,           "name": "John"         }       },       {         "id": "ABC10002",         "amount": 5000,         "deposit": 100,         "applicant": {           "age": 25,           "name": "Paul"         }       },       {         "id": "ABC10015",         "amount": 1000,         "deposit": 100,         "applicant": {           "age": 12,           "name": "George"         }       }     ]   } }    OUTPUT EVENT  If the request is evaluated successfully, the system returns a RulesResponse event with matching kogitoruleunitid, kogitoruleunitquery and subject (if present) containing the output facts in the data field.  EXAMPLE OF RULESRESPONSE EVENT   {   "specversion": "1.0",   "id": "d54ace84-6788-46b6-a359-b308f8b21778",   "source": "find-all-application-amounts",   "type": "RulesResponse",   "subject": "TheSubject",   "kogitoruleunitid": "org.kie.kogito.queries.LoanUnit",   "kogitoruleunitquery": "FindAllApplicationAmounts",   "data": [     {       "amounts": 8000     }   ] }     ERROR EVENT  If, for some reason, the request event is malformed or contains wrong information so that the evaluation can’t be triggered, a RulesResponseError is sent as output.  In this case the data field contains a string that specifies the error type:  Error TypeMeaningBAD_REQUESTMalformed input event (e.g. when some mandatory fields are missing)QUERY_NOT_FOUNDThe specified rule unit or query can’t be found in the current service   EXAMPLES  The Kogito Examples repository contains two examples, and , that you can use as a starting point to practice with this addon.  They also contain tests for every possible variation in the structure of the input/output events supported by the addon in the src/test/resources/events subfolder.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 3 - Example data architecture  In our  from this series we talked about the logical common architectural elements found in an intelligent data as a service (iDaaS) solution for the healthcare industry.       The process was laid out how we approached the use case and how portfolio solutions are the base for researching a generic architecture. It continued by laying out the process of how we approached the use case by researching successful customer portfolio solutions as the basis for a generic architecture.  Having completed our discussions on the common architectural elements, it's now time to look at a specific example. This article walks you through an example data integration scenario showing how expanding the previously discussed elements provides an example for healthcare data integration scenarios.     ARCHITECTURE REVIEW  As mentioned before, the architectural details covered here are based on real solutions using open source technologies. The example scenario presented here is a generic common architecture that was uncovered while researching those solutions. It's our intent to provide guidance and not deep technical details.  This section covers the visual representations as presented, but it's expected that they'll be evolving based on future research. There are many ways to represent each element in this architecture, but we've chosen a format that we hope makes it easy to absorb. Feel free to post comments at the bottom of this post, or  with your feedback.  Now let's take a look at the details in this architecture and outline the solution.     IDAAS INTEGRATION  This first look is of the overall data integration architecture for iDaaS with the details filled in that were discussed as logical elements previously. Starting on the left side of the diagram, the entry point for the actors you can expect for this use case. It's representing the edge devices and the actors, that are submitting requests and receiving responses.  These users are representing patients, vendors, suppliers, and clinical personnel. The administrators is representing the clinical personnel tasked with managing the various healthcare processes.  All requests enter through the API management element, used to secure and authenticate access to internal services and applications. The first collection of elements encountered is labeled as iDaaS Connect, where we find all the various integration services for specific communication channels. These are but a few of the options available, some being very generic such as iDaaS connect third party, but others are more specific to specialised healthcare standards; iDaaS connect HL7, iDaaS connect EDI, iDaaS connect FHIR, iDaaS connect Blue Button, and iDaaS connect ePrescribe. Each of these individual elements are integration services that handle both the message standards and transformation needed between systems and those standards.   The iDaaS Connect services will register events and receive event notification from the iDaaS connect events. This is a central hub that ensures all events can be registered, managed, and notifications sent when needed to the appropriate elements in the iDaaS architecture.   Events will often trigger elements of the iDaaS DREAM collection to take action, through the iDaaS event builder which captures business automation activities and the iDaaS intelligent data router. This data router is capable of managing where specific data needs to be sent, both inbound to sources and outbound to application or service destinations. It's assisted by the iDaaS connect data distribution element which ensures integration with all manner of data sources which might be in local or remote locations such as a public cloud. There are all manner of possible, and optional, external services that a healthcare organisation might integrate from third-party or externally hosted services such as reporting services, security, analytics, monitoring & logging, external API management, big data, and other partner data services.  Finally, the iDaaS architecture provides both conformance and insights into the knowledge being managed by the offered solutions. The iDaaS knowledge insight element manages analytics and insights into the data available across the live platform. This can be setup to provide near-realtime gathering and reporting as organisational need require. An essential requirement for any healthcare organisation is to maintain compliancy to national laws, data privacy, and other transitional requirements. The iDaaS knowledge conformance element is a set of applications and tools that allow for any organisation to automate compliancy and regulation adherence using rule systems customised to their own local needs. This is a very flexible element that can be designed to ensure that compliancy audit requirements are constantly met.  Next up, a look at the architectural solution with a focus on the data view.     IDAAS INTEGRATION (DATA)  Data connectivity through the iDaaS architecture provides a different look at the architecture and gives us insights into how one of the most valuable assets of a healthcare organisation is being processed.  It should be seen as the architecture is intended, as a guide and not a definitive must-do-it-this-way statement on how the data is being routed through as actors are engaging with the systems, applications, and services in this architecture.  Note that many of the data flows only one direction while it's fairly obvious it's going to flow both ways. We've chosen to note that in the flows that do not disrupt the clarity of the architecture diagram, and chose not to indicate where the intent is to show processing and flows for clarity from actors to systems on the backend.  It's left to the reader to explore these data diagrams and feel free to send comments our way.   WHAT'S NEXT  This was just a short overview of an example data integration architecture for the intelligent data as a service architecture.   An overview of this series on intelligent data as a service architecture:   1.   2.   3.   4.   5.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[   It's that time of year again when we get the call for papers!  I heard the call and thought this year would be a perfect time to go all in with sessions around our architectures based on a series of talks we've designed to showcase the various aspects we cover. Some are vertical aligned and others are just customer domains, but all of them include extensive research into how to implement successful architectures at scale.  Last week the call for papers closed and the internal committees are starting to churn through all of the excellent content they've been given. Sometime in March 2022 we should hear back from them.  How about a look at the various sessions we've put together where I'll be presenting with my good friends in the architecture team?  We've started a series called Talking Architecture Shop to host our various architectural explorations and they've been well received so far. For Red Hat Summit 2022 we've pushed the following into the selection process, with co-speakers listed and the name of the theme submitted into.

<p>Sadly, we have to start our editorial with a less-than-ideal piece of news. In case, you somehow missed, be aware that some vulnerabilities have been found in Log4J. Being one of the most used Java library, it is a rather critical issue. Please take look at this article to know <a href="http://www.mastertheboss.com/jbossas/jboss-log/how-to-handle-cve-2021-44228-in-java-applications/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=how-to-handle-cve-2021-44228-in-java-applications">How to fix Log4j CVE-2021-44228</a>.</p>
<p>Some other projects from the JBoss community may also have been impacted. Please check any project you are currently using and see if, like <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/12/kie-log4j2-exploit-cve-2021-44228.html">KIE</a> or <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/12/13/infinispan-log4j-cve-releases">InfiniSpan</a>, they have provided information on the impact of the vulnerability.</p>

<p>This past week, the Wildfly Elytron team (a team specializing in server and client side security) participated in the <a href="https://ghc.anitab.org/programs-and-awards/open-source-day/">Open Source Day</a> hackathon.
It is an all day hackathon celebrating Open Source technologies and allowing participants to learn about Open Source and contribute to projects designed to solve real world problems.</p>
<p>Issues in the Elytron issue tracker were triaged ahead of the event and new contributors were onboarded and taught about Git, creating and submitting pull requests, and how Open Source works.
The event went well for the Elytron team with double the amount of PRs submitted than in the Summer Open Source Day!</p>
<p>We’d also like to mention that in Wildfly 25 support has been added for the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 2.0. More information and a sample application can be found within <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/10/14/MicroProfile-Reactive-Messaging-2.0-in-WildFly-25/">the announcement</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 23 September 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to yet another installment of the JBoss Editorial! September is coming to an end, but it has been a pretty busy month for the JBoss community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quarkus">Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quarkus has really come a long way since the first release only a few years ago. A testament to the fact is certainly the compelling user stories released by the project’s team in the last weeks. First, we have <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/logicdrop-customer-story/">How Quarkus Improved Logicdrop’s Developer Experience and Process</a>, followed by <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/adoptium-customer-story/">Eclipse Adoptium Uses Quarkus for high volume Java SE distribution API</a>. And we even have a nice retail business use case, with <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/decathlon-user-story/">VCStream: a new messaging platform for DECATHLON’s Value Chain, built on Quarkus</a>!</p>
<p>So, if you have yet to jump onboard the Quarkus train, it’s really time to do so! And, to help you do it, you can check out this nice tutorial on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/09/20/quarkus-spring-developers-getting-started">Quarkus for Spring developers: Getting started</a>.

<h2 id="_decaf_ansible_for_jboss_middleware">Decaf' - Ansible for JBoss middleware</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>In the past months, we’ve been doing some hard work to ensure that JBoss software can fit as neatly as possible within an Ansible playbook. There is a still a lot to be done, but we are already quite proud of to two Ansible collections we have released. The first one is called, JCliff, but will soon be renamed to WildFly, as it aims to integrate, as smoothly as possible, the app server into Ansible. The latest version (v.0.0.10) has already a few exciting features:
* systemd integration, a reusable role to help set up WildFly as a systemd service
* a reusable role to install JDBC driver and their module
* and, of course, more fine-tuning of WildFly’s subsystem thanks to the JCLiff (embedded in the collection) which allows Ansible to configure mod_cluster, sockets, JMS queues and so many other features.</p>
<p>We are also very happy about the release of JWS Collection for Ansible (v0.0.2), which allows us to quickly set up Apache Tomcat or its counterpart, JBoss Web Server, but also provides some nice features, like integration with systemd and common criteria (partial) compliance checking. Please check our blog entry about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/08/30/automate-red-hat-jboss-web-server-deployments-ansible">Ansible collection for Apache Tomcat / JWS</a> for more details!</p>
<p>(Given that those are projects I work on, I fully assume that this entry is a shameless plug :) )</p>
<p><em>That’s all for today! Please join us again in two weeks for another installment of our JBoss editorial! Stay safe and healthy in the meantime.</em></p>

<p>Mario Fusco’s latest entry on the Kogito blog gives a lot of food for thought and is highly recommended.
In his article, Mario digs into migrating from Drools and start using Kogito and Quarkus.
He shows you how to start building microservices that you can eventually deploy into Function as a Service (FaaS) environments to provide stateless rule evaluation.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 11 August 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>After short pause for the summer holiday, welcome back to this new installment of the JBoss Editorial! As always, the JBoss community has been quite active and there is quite a lot to cover today, especially on hybrid cloud and Kogito. Let’s dive right in!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_hybrid_cloud">Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>During the last weeks, Christina Lei did a quite interesting series of articles on hybrid cloud. After an <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/overview-of-making-hybrid-multi-cloud.html">overview of making hybrid cloud</a>, she explores some in-depth topic like <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/hybrid-multi-cloud-dynamic-security.html">dynamic security</a> or <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/observability-in-hybrid-multi-cloud">observability</a>. To conclude this serie, another article covers <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/a-study-of-hosting-and-managing-on.html">hosting and managing on hybrid cloud</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the new release of <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/kogito-1-9-1-released.html">Kogito 1.9.1</a>, it’s time to explore (maybe again) all the potential of this framework. And fortunately, there are a lot of in-depth articles released recently doing just that! Let’s start with one on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/how-to-capture-business-decisions-using-dmn-introduction-to-some-basic-patterns-and-their-value.html">how to capture decisions using DMN</a> followed by a tutorial on how to implement <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/kogito-task-deadlines.html">task’s deadline</a> with Kogito.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of it, you’ll want to learn how to manage your <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/four-steps-to-author-bpmn-and-dmn-assets-on-gitpod-io.html">BPMN and DMN assets on gitpod.io</a>. Or explore <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/event-driven-decisioning-with-amq-streams-and-kogito.html">event-driven decisinning with AMQ streams and Kogito</a>. If those articles have but open your appetite for the framework, you can carry on with a tutorial on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/how-develop-better-widgets-with-showcase-appl.html">how to develop better widgets</a> or how to <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/add-data-from-kie-execution-server-for-authoring-dashboards.html">add data from KIE server for authoring dashboards</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_from_the_community">From the community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Karina Varela has a post about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/24/automating-rule-based-services-java-and-kogito">automating rule-based services with Java and Kogito</a> up on the Red Hat Developer Blog. The post focuses on Kogito and using it to build, package, and automate the deployment of those rule-based services on Kubernetes and OpenShift!</p>
<p>James Falkner quickly tackles <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/07/01/resteasy-reactive-and-more-quarkus-20">RESTEasy Reactive in Quarkus 2.0</a> over on the Red Hat Developer Blog. With the release of Quarkus 2.0 there are a number of things that have improved. Using REST in a reactive way is one of them. Quarkus 2.0 utilizes Eclipse Vert.x 4 and does some optimizations at build time to further increase performance of REST services.</p>
<p>If you’re using Red Hat 3scale API Management and have a need to use WebSockets, be sure to check out Srikanth Kalluru’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/07/01/how-expose-websocket-endpoint-using-red-hat-3scale-api-management">blog post</a> for a quick three step walk through of how to get it done!</p>
<p>Mauro Vocale has a three part series, part four is not out yet, about moving Java programs to the cloud. <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/25/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-1-incremental-approach-using-jakarta-ee">Part one</a> introduces you to the legacy application and gets it up and running on OpenShift. This gets you familiar with what the application does and what to expect from further refactorings in subsequent posts. In <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/28/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-2-upgrade-legacy-java-application-jakarta">part two</a> the application will move from Java 8 to Java 11, JBoss EAP 7.3 and Jakarta EE. Lastly, in <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/30/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-3-integrate-microprofile-services">part three</a> the application will be moved to microservices. Additional monitoring tools will be introduced including Prometheus and Jaeger. The application will be updated for handling restarts, health checks, and other configuration settings.</p>
<p>Over in the BPM arena, there are three posts to take a look at: <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/custom-logic-in-bpmn.html">Custom logic in BPMN</a> by Kirill Gaevksii, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/07/how-to-start-contributing-to-drools-executable-model.html">How to start contributing to Drools executable model</a> where Luca Molteni discusses getting your feet with contributing to Drools’s "Executable Model Compiler". Lastly, Matteo Mortari discusses <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/intelligent-kafka-message-routing-using-drools-dmn-engine-and-apache-camel.html">using Drools DMN and Apache Camel to intelligently route Kafka messages</a>. It includes a video as well as various examples and code to really sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Wildfly 24.0.0.Final includes a preview of Jakarta EE 9.1 features. Jeff Mesnil discusses <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/07/01/wildfly-preview-bootable-jar/">how to try these features out using a bootable jar</a>. There’s also a section about getting up and running using OpenShift!</p>

<p>Katia and Ryan on the Infinispan team released a nice two-part series of posts that explained how they built an online game across data centers and multiple cloud providers for this year’s Summit keynote demonstration.
In the first part, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/28/building-real-time-leaderboard-red-hat-data-grid-and-quarkus-hybrid-kubernetes">Building a real-time leaderboard with Infinispan and Quarkus on a hybrid Kubernetes deployment</a>, Katia and Ryan describe how they designed and implemented various services using Infinispan and Quarkus.
With part two, they explain how using the Infinispan Operator greatly reduced the complexity of standing up their clusters, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/08/create-and-manage-red-hat-data-grid-services-hybrid-cloud">Creating and managing Infinispan services in the hybrid cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Tommaso Teofili’s recent post, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/autotuning-lime-explanations-with-few-predictions.html">Autotuning LIME explanations with few predictions</a>, outlines how to automatically tune LIME hyperparameters to achieve more stable explanations and comes with a PR that lets you dig into all the technical aspects covered in the post.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/rhpam-connectivity-to-external-amq-configurations-in-openshift.html">RHPAM connectivity to external AMQ configurations in OpenShift</a> by Michael Perez takes an in-depth look at connecting to an external AMQ with the aim of lowering the memory footprint for RHPAM pods as well as other deployment optimizations.
It’s an interesting read with good technical considerations to sink your teeth into so go give it a look.</p>
<p>Over on the WildFly blog, Jeff Mesnil walks us through the process of changing logging levels for cloud-based WildFly applications on the fly.
Take a look at Jeff’s script and straightforward commands to help you easily modify logs for debugging in his post, <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/06/15/change-log-level-wildfly-cloud/">How to Change Logging Level for WildFly on the Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Bilgin Ibryam is back with a post on the Red Hat Developer blog titled <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/14/application-modernization-patterns-apache-kafka-debezium-and-kubernetes">Application modernization patterns with Apache Kafka, Debezium, and Kubernetes</a>.
I really enjoyed this one as Bilgin expertly puts application modernization in context and examines different patterns, tools, and open-source ecosystems that can help you migrate brown-field systems to more modern, event-driven services as well as design green-field services that are future proof by providing the ability to evolve over time.
Be sure to catch up on this one if you haven’t already read it.</p>
<p>Just in time for your summer reading list the first book dedicated to Keycloak has been published, <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2021/06/book.adoc">Keycloak - Identity and Access Management for Modern Applications</a>.
Congrats to authors Stian Thorgersen and Pedro Igor Silva.
It’s an impressive achievement and no doubt the book is full of invaluable expertise.</p>

<p>In our last editorial we mentioned Eric Schabell’s series on a retail data framework.
Since then Eric has obviously been hard at work as his next two posts in the series, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/retail-data-framework-common-architectural-elements.html">Retail data framework - Common architectural elements</a> and <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/06/retail-data-framework-example-data-architecture.html">Retail data framework - Example data architecture</a>.
If you haven’t caught up on that series yet, then I highly recommend taking a look to learn about data flows and management in a retail context.</p>
<p>Eric has also posted the first in his next series, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/cloud-adoption-an-architectural-introduction.html">Cloud adoption - An architectural introduction</a>.
This series is focused on proven integrations, structures, and interactions with the goal of enabling readers to implement and adopt cloud-based solutions using open-source technologies.
I’m really excited about this series and can’t wait to see what Eric brings in his next posts.</p>

<p>Jeff Mesnil has authored a very helpful and detailed look at building and deploying WildFly applications on OpenShift using Helm Charts in his post, <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/05/05/helm-charts-for-wildfly/">Helm Chart for WildFly</a></p>
<p>Over on the Infinispan blog, Ryan Emerson has shared some details about the CLI compiled to a native image in <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/05/21/infinispan-cli-image">Infinispan Native CLI</a>, which is well worth a read.
You should also try downloading the latest Infinispan 12 server version and taking it for a spin with the native CLI!</p>
<p>Another recent one from the Infinispan team comes from Katia Aresti who, along with Ryan Emerson, explains how they <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/28/building-real-time-leaderboard-red-hat-data-grid-and-quarkus-hybrid-kubernetes">built a real-time leaderboard using Data Grid and several Quarkus extensions</a> to add some magic to this year’s Red Hat Summit Keynote.</p>
<p>Jacopo Rota on the Kogito blog explains how to <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/05/getting-started-with-trustyai-in-only-15-minutes.html">how to deploy a Kogito service together with the TrustyAI infrastructure on an OpenShift cluster in only 15 minutes</a>!</p>
<p>Have you been wanting to find out more about Shenandoah GC? Well, you should dive right in and check out Roman Kennke’s informative post, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/20/shenandoah-garbage-collection-openjdk-16-concurrent-reference-processing">Shenandoah garbage collection in OpenJDK 16: Concurrent reference processing</a>.</p>
<p>Bilgin Ibryam has recently posted <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2021/05/data-gateways-of-future.html">Data Gateways in the Cloud Native Era</a> that examines how data gateway components support different use cases and offer a solution for hybrid workloads spread across multiple cloud providers.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least is Claus Ibsen’s webinar, <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2021/05/webinar-integrate-systems-in-age-of.html">Integrate systems in the age of Quarkus and Camel</a>, that explores how the trio of Camel Quarkus, Camel K, and Kamelets simplify the work to manage and bind systems together.</p>

<p>Eric Schabell never disappoints and his previous series on architectural elements in a real-time stock control solution for retail was no exception.
Eric rounds that series off nicely with <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/real-time-stock-control-example-stock-control-architecture.html">Real-time stock control - Example stock control architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Not one to rest for long, Eric Schabell launches a new series that tackles how to create a framework for accessing retail data from customers, stock, stores, and staff across multiple internal teams.
I’m sure it’s going to be a brilliant series so go have a look for yourself and find out more in his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/retail-data-framework-architectural-introduction.html">Retail data framework - An architectural introduction</a>.</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed reading through Christina and Eric’s <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/05/tooling-guide-for-getting-started-with.html">Tooling guide for Getting Started with Apache Camel in 2021</a>.
It’s a well put together beginner’s guide to tools that can help with Camel applications.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 26 April 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another - slightly delayed, installment of our JBoss Editorial! If anything, the last two weeks in the Jboss community has been all about Quarkus and Kogito. Indeed, you’ll find in this post a trove of information and news on the two projects. But also, an exciting opportunity on Keycloak! Without any further ado, let’s jump right in.</p><p></p>

<p>With the Red Hat Summit coming up tomorrow, you may want to check out this post of our very own Eric D. Schabell on the new format we are trying out this year: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/red-hat-summit-2021-how-to-enjoy-this-three-part-event-series.html">Red Hat Summit: How to enjoy this three-part event series</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, Eric has, as always, delivered a steady stream of content in the past weeks, with a focus on headless architecture. It started with a first post on <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-an-architectural-introduction.html">Headless eCommerce - An architectural introduction</a>, to which he did a followup on: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-common-architectural-elements.html">Headless eCommerce - Common architectural elements</a>.</p>
<p>Headless architecture was also part of the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/store-health-and-safety-architectural-introduction.html">Store health and safety architectural introduction</a>, which also was followed up by a post on <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/store-health-and-safety-common-architectural-elements.html">Store health and safety common architectural elements</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As mentioned in our introduction, Quarkus has been the focused on many content released in the last weeks. On top of that, as you’ll see in the releases section of this editorial, the project has released not one, but two versions, including an alpha of the upcoming Quarkus 2.0.</p>
<p>Let’s first take a look at the content relating to Quarkus as a development platform. If you are still new to Quarkus, you may want to start then with this post about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/07/deploy-quarkus-everywhere-with-red-hat-enterprise-linux-rhel/">deploying Quarkus everywhere with RHEL</a>. After that, still on the topic of packaging and deployment, you can learn how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/08/build-even-faster-quarkus-applications-with-fast-jar/">build even faster Quarkus applications with Fast jar</a>.</p>
<p>If you are already onboard Quarkus and his very neat development model, you’ll be quite happy to learn that <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/14/mandrel-a-specialized-distribution-of-graalvm-for-quarkus/">Mandrel, a specialized distribution of GraalVM for Quarkus</a> is coming up!</p>
<p>As you may be aware, Quarkus comes already with quite a few supported extensions, but you may still want to learn more about <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/solving-problems-with-custom-extensions/">custom extensions and which problems they can help you solve</a>.</p>
<p>If you are already running or developing a few webapps on Quarkus, you’ll be interested in <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/gui-react-patternfly/">learning how to add eye candy to it</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 8 April 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Hello! Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial that brings you news and updates from our community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_release_roundup">Release roundup</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Let’s start things off with congrats to the teams on their hard work!</p>
<div class="ulist square">
<ul class="square">
<li>
<p><a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/04/07/infinispan-12-1-0-final">Infinispan 12.1.0.Final</a> is released!<br>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-13-0-final-released/">Quarkus 1.13</a> and <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-13-1-final-released/">Quarkus 1.13.1.Final</a> are now available with loads of great new features and improvements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Our very own Bela Ban has also recently finished off the work on <a href="https://github.com/belaban/JGroups/tree/jgroups-4.2.12.Final">JGroups 4.2.12</a> and <a href="https://github.com/belaban/JGroups/tree/jgroups-5.1.6.Final">JGroups 5.1.6</a>.
While there might not be an "official" annoucement on his blog, you can check Bela’s commit history for details.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_from_the_community">From the community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Let’s take a look at what’s been happening in the community since our last editorial.</p>
<p>First up is a post by Hao Wu, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/how-to-interact-with-business-processes-using-camel-routes.html">How to Interact with Business Processes Using Camel Routes</a>, that neatly explains using Apache Camel to interact with business processes deployed in a KIE server.</p>
<p>Rebecca Searls, over at the RESTEasy blog, recently added a post titled <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/2021/04/05/blog-ParamConverter-with-Quarkus/">JAX-RS ParamConverter with Quarkus</a> that shows how to write RESTful services with Quarkus using the JAX-RS ParamConverter.</p>
<p>Eric Schabell has, yet again, delivered some great posts recently that demonstrate how community technology can solve real world business problems.</p>
<p>Finishing off a series of articles on point of sale architectures, Eric delves in a specific example in his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/point-of-sale-example-image-distribution-architecture.html">Point of sale - Example image distribution architecture</a>.
Be sure to check the links at the end of the post in case you missed any of the other articles in his architecture blueprint for point of sale imaging in retail.</p>
<p>Not one to rest, Eric kicks things off with another series to share an architectural blueprint for the use case of deploying a container-based eCommerce website while moving away from tightly coupled existing eCommerce platform.</p>
<p>This first article in this series is <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-an-architectural-introduction.html">Headless eCommerce - An architectural introduction</a>, which gives you an outline for the use case.</p>
<p>Eric then continues the series with his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-common-architectural-elements.html">Headless eCommerce - Common architectural elements</a>.
In this article, Eric goes into detail on common generic elements that make up the architecture blueprint for the headless eCommerce use case.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the rest of Eric’s series!
I’m sure there’s lots more great information on the way.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 25 March 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we search through the JBoss Community for interesting articles and updates</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introducing_the_prolific_eric_schabell">Introducing the prolific Eric Schabell</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are a regular reader of the JBoss Editorial  you will be very familiar with the work of Eric Schabell, arguably one of the most prolific writers within the JBoss Community.  This edition is no different and sees Eric product three more articles.</p>
<p>Eric’s first article is a continuation of his Supply Chain Integration Blueprint discussion.  In this article Eric <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/supply-chain-integration-example-store-integration-architecture.html">expands on the common architectural elements discussed previously and outlines an example Store integration architecture for Supply Chain integration</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s second article walks us through <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/codeready-containers-howto-setup-openshift-47-on-local-machine.html">the necessary steps for installing and running the OpenShift Container Platform 4.7 on our local machines</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s final article kicks off a new series of articles within which he will introduce a new architectural blueprint covering <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/point-of-sale-an-architectural-introduction.html">"Simplifying and modernizing central management of distributed point-of-sale devices with built in support for container based applications"</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_whats_new_in_kogito_land">What’s new in Kogito land?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The <a href="http://kie.org">Kogito team</a> have been busy over the last few weeks publishing a number of interesting blog posts covering different aspects of the Kogito ecosystem.</p>
<p>We begin our coverage with an article written by William <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/building-prometheus-dashboards-in-business-central.html">demonstrating how to integrate metrics from a Prometheus datasource into the Business Central</a>.  The article walks you through the process from the creation of the data set within Dashbuilder, building the dashboard, how to consider filtering requirements and how to test the dashboard.</p>
<p>The next article, written by Manaswini, follows on from William’s article and <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/time-series-component-for-dashbuilder.html">demonstrates how you can further extend your dashboard through the integration and visualisation of time series data</a>.</p>
<p>The final article, written by Ricardo, introduces us to Kogito’s support for the <a href="https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/">CNCF Serverless Workflow</a> specification, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/restful-services-orchestration-with-kogito-and-openapi.html">allowing Kogito to provide a serverless interface to a service which can also be used to orchestrate RESTful services described through the OpenAPI standard</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_clustering_wildfly_using_dns_ping">Clustering WildFly using DNS ping</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>When running within a kubernetes environment it is natural to consider the <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#_kube_ping">KUBE_PING protocol</a> for cluster discovery, a protocol relying on the ability to query the kubernetes API server.  If you want to remain agnostic of your environment, or if you do not have sufficient permissions to query the kubernetes API server, then an alternative approach to consider would be the <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">DNS_PING protocol</a> as <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">demonstrated by Yeray using a simple WildFly bootable JAR application</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_optimizing_camel_3_9_no_more_saw_tooth_jvm_garbage_collection">Optimizing Camel 3.9, no more saw tooth JVM garbage collection</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The upcoming Camel 3.9 release will include some additional, significant improvements in the performance of the internal routing engine leading to a dramatic reduction in object allocation during continuous use.  The Camel team focussed on the five major areas of the codebase they had identified during performance testing with the intention of reducing the allocation count as much as possible, they managed to go one better and achieved a sustained object allocation count of zero!  For more information take a look at <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2021/03/apache-camel-39-no-more-saw-tooth-jvm.html">Claus' blog describing the effort</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_monitoring_quarkus_applications_on_openshift">Monitoring Quarkus applications on OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are running a Quarkus application on OpenShift you will most likely have a need for integrating with the centralised prometheus instance within the cluster.  This integration is fairly straight forward and can be achieved after following only a few simple steps <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/micrometer-prometheus-openshift/">as ably demonstrated by Jose</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_from_the_community">From the community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>There’s been a lot of activity since the last editorial so let’s take a look.</p>
<p>First up is Ramon Gordillo’s rather interesting take on moving legacy technology on Kubernetes.
Ramon starts by pointing out that even software that is considered "legacy" and traditionally on-prem is often packed with new and useful features.
Add to that the fact that many containerized applications still rely on legacy systems - "not all apps are greenfield" - and he builds a solid case for doing something that might otherwise induce a few gasps.
Go see how Ramon tackles running IBM DB2 in containers, <a href="https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2021/03/trying-db2-in-kubernetes-for-developers/">Trying DB2 in Kubernetes for developers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/migrating-jbpm-images-secured-by-ldap-to-elytron.html">Migrating jBPM images secured by LDAP to Elytron</a> by Gonzalo Muñoz Fernández is one that I thoroughly enjoyed.
If you’re not familiar with Elytron it is, as Gonzalo explains, Wildfly’s security framework that puts security management and application access into a single subsystem.
In his post, Gonzalo clearly describes and then steps through how to migrate jBPM images from PicketBox, which is a security subsystem based on JAAS login modules, over to Elytron.</p>
<p>Also on the Kogito blog, Paul Brown and Emily Murphy take on the challenge of <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/optimizing-covid-19-vaccination-appointment-scheduling.html">Optimizing COVID-19 vaccination appointment scheduling</a>.
Their post details the approach for using OptaPlanner to handle planning constraints and automatically assign vaccination appointments.
Getting vaccinations rolled out globally is a massive logistical and planning challenge so it’s comforting to know our community is providing tooling to get us all back to "normal".</p>
<p>The Red Hat Developer blog has a couple of recent entries focused on JavaScript that are both good reads.</p>
<p>Michael Dawson introduces us to the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/08/introduction-to-the-node-js-reference-architecture-part-1-overview/">Node.js reference architecture from Red Hat and IBM</a> and explains their reasons for creating it.
The goal is to help developers make good choices when navigating the vibrant and extensive JavaScript ecosystem by recommending packages based on shared experience across teams and projects.</p>
<p>Joel Lord takes us through <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/04/building-rootless-containers-for-javascript-front-ends/">Building rootless containers for JavaScript front ends</a> to demonstrate how you can avoid security vulnerabilities and potential disaster.</p>

<h2 id="_evangelists_corner">Evangelist’s corner</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Our ever productive Eric Schabell has brought us some fantastic content that should really get you thinking about community technology can apply to solve real world business problems.</p>
<p>Similarly to James and Emily’s post on the Kogito blog, Eric shows how <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/business-optimisation-architecture-example-vaccine-scheduling-.html">retail pharmacies can optimize scheduling to provide customer vaccinations</a>.</p>
<p>Eric also provides a <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/supply-chain-integration-an-architectural-introduction.html">architectural blueprint for supply-chain integration</a> that comes with a treasure trove of resources and is well worth delving into.</p>

<h2 id="_kogito">Kogito</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are already a Kogito user or if you are interested in exploring this software, there were a few articles released in the past two weeks that you might find interesting. The first one is on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/kogito-notifications-api.html">Kogito Notification API</a> which is followed nicely by the second one on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/event-driven-decisions-with-kogito.html">Event-driven decisions with Kogito</a></p>
<p>If you want something more practical, you’ll certainly enjoy the third article on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/3-steps-to-author-bpmn-dmn-editors-on-github-codespaces.html">3 steps to author BPMN and DMN assets on GitHub Codespaces</a></p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Here we are again, it’s been two weeks and we’re into the second month of 2021!
How quickly times flies!
In this edition, expect to find release information, blog posts, and general updates from around the JBoss Community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases">Releases!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-2-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11.2.Final</a> is the second maintenance release for the Quarkus 1.11 branch. The notable bug fix with this version is updating to Hibernate ORM 5.4.27.SP1 which fixes a potential data loss issue. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/releases/tag/1.11.2.Final">full changelog for more info</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-3-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11.3.Final</a> is a quick bug fix release that focused on a regression making it impossible to build native executables if your project was using both RESTEasy and OpenTracing. <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/releases/tag/1.11.3.Final">Please see the full changelog</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/02/11/WildFly2201-Released/">Wildfly 22.0.1</a> has been released, about a month after 22.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://vertx.io/blog/eclipse-vert-x-4-0-2/">Vert.x 4.0.2 released</a> recently. The 4.0.1 release also happened, but contained potential memory leaks and the team decided not to announce it and proceed with another quick release to fix the issues. <a href="https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.0.2-Release-Notes">Please view the release notes for more details</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/kogito-tooling-0-8-3-released.html">Kogito Tooling 0.8.3 released</a> a few days ago. With the release of 0.8.1, the Kogito team released their official version of the BPMN and DMN standalone editors.

<h2 id="_highlights_from_the_blogosphere">Highlights from the blogosphere</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Eric Schabell published a migration guide for a traditional JBoss BPM application running either within a VM or on bare-metal to running inside containers using OpenShift Container Platform.
In <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/4-easy-steps-for-migrating-projects-to-openshift-container-platform.html">his post he breaks the migration down into four steps</a>.
I won’t detail them all here, but the steps are very easy and you should be able to get up and running quickly on your own laptop, even without having some of the tech installed previously!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/improvements-of-project-authoring-in-business-central.html">Abhishek Kumar discussed project authoring improvements within Business Central recently on the KIE Blog</a>.
The features he discusses are:
. Opening projects directly with a URL
. Changing the default asset page size
. Security permissions for project screen tools and tabs</p>
<p>Each of these help users in the authoring process within Business Central through either ease of use or security!</p>
<p>Still on the KIE Blog, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/01/how-to-use-a-pmml-file-in-dmn-editor-vscode.html">Yeser Amer demonstrates how to use PMML models in the DMN Editor</a>.
PMML support was released with version 0.7.0.
PMML is an XML file describing a predictive model often generated by data mining or AI algorithms.
The support for this format within the VSCode plugin was recently released and follows the same usage patterns as those found within Business Central, so it may very well be familiar to some.</p>
<p>A number of blogs about Quarkus sprang up over the past couple of weeks!</p>
<p>Firstly, Georgios Andrianakis discusses <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive-faq/">achieving massive performance without headaches</a> in a RESTEasy application on Quarkus using RESTEasy Reactive.
He talks about the different models, how to use them, the best way to get performance out of each model, and why this will likely becoming the default model within RESTEasy on Quarkus in the near future.</p>
<p>Clement Escoffier <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/getting-started-amqp/">helps us get started with AMQP in Quarkus</a> with an in-depth demo similar to using Kafka.
He walks you through the basics and gives you a running project which he steps through to show you all the basics.</p>
<p>Over on the Red Hat Developers Blog, Eric Deandrea shows us a very cool trick, or maybe the power of Quarkus’s Spring compatibility, about running a Spring Boot application on Quarkus without changing a single line of Java code!
It is definitely worth the read, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/09/spring-boot-on-quarkus-magic-or-madness/">head on over to check it out</a>!</p>
<p>If you missed the announcement about Quarkus remote development, be sure to read up about it by Daniel Oh <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/11/enhancing-the-development-loop-with-quarkus-remote-development/">on the Red Hat Developer Blog</a>.
Using a mutable-jar package, you can deploy onto OpenShift and continue to develop remotely without having to build a new container and push every time you want to see a change!
What an amazing way to build on the cloud and make sure everything works correctly without having slow downs!</p>
<p>Yeray Borges of the Wildfly team <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/02/01/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-openshift/">demonstrates how to deploy a bootable Wildfly application jar which caches the HTTP session state</a>.
It’s a useful option allowing you to build and test locally and then push to OpenShift with minimal changes ensuring your application still works in the cloud.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mario Fusco and Edson Yanaga have a presentation from a recent DevNation Live about designing a Java API.
Check it out over on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/design-java-apis">the Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Certainly worth the watch if you develop APIs in Java (which should be most of you).</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 28 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Hello! Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial that brings you news and updates from our community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases">Releases!!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Infinispan 12 release, codenamed <code>Lockdown</code>, brings a ton of new features and improvements.
Indexing and querying capabilities have seen a number of improvements with the help of Hibernate Search integration.
ProtoStream marshalling is upgraded with a new <code>@ProtoAdapter</code> annotation that lets you easily integrate third-party classes.
It’s a pretty elegant solution to what could present itself as a real headache for developers.
Speaking of marshalling improvements, Infinispan 12 also makes your life easier by automatically generating and registering <code>SerializationContextInitializer</code> implementations to marshall user types.
Also notable is the SPI for cross-site replication merge conflicts, which continues on the brilliant work that team has done to provide a solution for ensuring data integrity.
There’s a lot going on in Infinispan 12 and probably too much to try and sum up here so why not head over and read all the details in the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/01/25/infinispan-12-final">Infinispan 12.0.0.Final Announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the entire Infinispan team on all the hard work.</p>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-0-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11</a> is here!
This release brings you RESTEasy Reactive, which is a new JAX-RS implementation for writing RESTful services.
Quarkus 1.11 also introduces the Dev UI so you can quickly visualize all your loaded extensions, access docs, and more.
Of course there are other things in Quarkus 1.11 but RESTEasy Reactive and the Dev UI look to be quite promising indeed.</p>
<p>The Quarkus team keep things rolling with the release of <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/intellij-quarkus-tools-1.3.0/">Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ 1.3.0</a> that adds codestarts to the Quarkus project wizard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2021/01/keycloak-1202-released.html">Keycloak 12.0.2</a> is now available too!

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 14 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to the first installment of our JBoss Editorial for 2021! And to start the year, we have a brand new major release of the core product of the JBoss community! Yes, Wildfly 22 is out!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_wildfly_22_and_camel_3_7">Wildfly 22 and Camel 3.7</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Yes! We have a brand new major version of Wildfly! <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/01/13/WildFly22-Final-Released/">Wildfly 22 is out!</a>.</p>
<p>This release includes support for use of log4j2 in applications, new base health and metrics subsystems to provide server observability for users who don’t need the application instrumentation that comes with MicroProfile Health and Metrics, and a number of other features related to management, provisioning, messaging and security. Plus numerous bug fixes, enhancements and component upgrades.</p>
<p>On top of that, there is also an updated version of the new tech-preview WildFly Preview distribution. This will allow the community have a look at what Wildfly developers are doing for Jakarta EE 9 support, along with other changes in the server architecture that are expected to appear later in 2021.</p>
<p>Wildfly 22 is already a nice treat, but we also have <a href="https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/12/Camel37-Whatsnew/">Camel 3.7</a>, which also quite exciting, and fortunately for all of us, Claus Ibsen has published a review of what he called <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2020/12/apache-camel-37-lts-released-fastest.html">the fastest Camel ever!</a> So, go check it out if you want to know more about this camel release.</p>

<h2 id="_tech_bytes">Tech bytes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>A few interesting technical articles came out in the last weeks, so we’ll try to catch you up with three of them here. First, we have an excellent one from Bela Ban on <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/12/running-jgroups-raft-as-service.html">running JGroups raft as a service</a>. It’s very hands on post, focusing on getting everything running. Then we have a longer walkthrough to let you experiment on <a href="https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2020/12/spring-boot-embedded-cache-with-infinispan-in-kubernetes/">using Spring boot embedded cache with Infinispan on Kubernetes</a>. Certainly, worth a look, isn’t it? The last one is, of course, on Quarkus, because Quarkus is, as it should, all the rage lately. In this article, Clément Escoffier took the time to explain some of the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/magic-control">magic beneath Quarkus and Vert.x</a> and why this is the kind magic you to have as a developer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_evangelists_corner">Evangelist’s Corner</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As always, our very own Eric Schabell has been busy in the few last weeks and released a steady stream of new content. First, he published <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/01/codeready-containers-installing.html">part4 - Installing business automation operator</a> of his series on CodeReady containers. He then revisited the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/12/codeready-containers-exploring-home-loan-mortgage-process.html">Home loan mortgage process using CodeReady Containers</a>. Still on the topic of CodeReady Containers, he provided a <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/01/codeready-containers-howto-setup-openshift-46-on-local-machine.html">How to setup the OpenShift Container Platform 4.6 on your local machine</a> follow by a tutorial on <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/12/codeready-containers-building-hr-process-with-openshift-operator.html">Building a Human Resources Process with an OpenShift Operator</a></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <article class="" data-tags="Christmas, 2020">
      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 25 December 2020</h1>
      <p>I’m writing this on Christmas Day and have spent the last week or so thinking about what I should put
into my traditional 25th of December entry. Then it came to me in that "lightbulb moment": I’d replicate,
more or less, what I said to my entire team/org before I went on vacation a few days earlier. It’s a summary
of the year and I think it’s relevant for our wider community too. So here it is in a slightly modified form …​</p>
<p>I wanted to spend a few minutes thanking you all for the work and interactions you’ve done over this testing year!
I don’t think anyone could have predicted 2020 at the start of the year and I think it’s fair to say that every one of us
has been affected in one way or another. Yet if you look back on the year and the accomplishments we’ve achieved
as a community, you could be forgiven for thinking this was a normal year!</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making Quarkus available to all OpenShift customers, which we announced at KubeCon, as well as continuing the innovation within
(e.g., Hibernate Reactive, RESTeasy Reactive);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knative/Serverless, where we now have 7 Working Group leads out of 15 in the Knative community, we also added Functions to OpenShift Serverless;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More and more of our technologies become available to Kube developers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continued our close involvement with AdoptOpenJDK (aka Eclipse Adoptium), helping to push it to even greater heights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many great innovations continued around efforts such as Kogito, Strimzi, Camel-K, Eclipse Vert.x, Infinispan, …​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all managed to host, attend, present at countless virtual conferences, workshops and Red Hat Summit; probably enough to realise what
we’re all missing from the real things!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eclipse MicroProfile 4.0 and Eclipse Jakarta EE 9.0 both come to life;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The list could go on and on (e.g., EAP XD, OptaPlanner, …) but my point isn’t so much to call out the successes that this
community have helped to drive but rather to illustrate that we were able to do these and more at all! In the
climate of 2020, retaining the kind of focus we have and continuing to go above and beyond, as many of you and the teams
have, is a testament to Red Hat and our communities, our culture and the supporting bonds you’ve all built up and nurtured. For that
alone I thank you and you should all be incredibly proud!</p>
<p>With that in mind, whether or not you celebrate Christmas or intend to take extended time away, make sure you do take time
to rest and recharge. Be with your friends and family as much as you can given the continuing Covid situation. Find time to unwind
but also congratulate yourself on coming together in 2020 and delivering so much to our communities, partners and customers. I’m not
even going to try to predict what 2021 will be like but if we can replicate what we’ve been able to do in 2020, I’m sure
we’ll all come through it stronger and together!</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 17 December 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial and last before the holidays! As always during this period of the year, we all rush to finish our ongoing tasks so that we can enjoy a bit of rest. And the projects of the JBoss community do the same, which means we have quite of lot to discuss today! So, without any further ado…​</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quarkus_and_resteasy_reactive">Quarkus and RestEasy Reactive</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The last months have certainly been quite active for Quarkus. Now part of the portfolio of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-quarkus">Red Hat products</a>, the project has everything but slow down. Just last week a new release, <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-10-3-final-released/">Quarkus 1.10.3</a> was published, but also RestEasy announced a large refactoring of its project <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive/">RestEasy Reactive</a> in order to integrate and support Quarkus even more. Alessio Soldano, one of the main developers of RestEasy, also shares his thoughts behind this project <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/2020/12/07/resteasy-reactive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s not all in the Quarkiverse! Andy Damevin released an interesting article on link:But that’s not all in the Quarkus-verse! Andy Damevin released an interesting article on new ways to discover Quarkus <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/extension-codestarts-a-new-way-to-learn-and-discover-quarkus/"> new ways to discover Quarkus using Extension codestarts</a>. Whether that you already know Quarkus or want to explore it for the first time, this one will be in any case quite interesting to you! Oh, and by the way Quarkiverse is by no means a "bon mot,” it’s the real thing: <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkiverse/">Quarkiverse Hub - Home of Community Extensions</a>, so go check out this article from George Gastaldi to know more about it!</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not the least, another article will help you <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/12/08/spring-boot-to-quarkus-migrations-and-more-in-red-hats-migration-toolkit-for-applications-5-1-0/">migrating your Spring Boot app to Quarkus using the Red Hat migration toolkit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_apache_avro_and_apicurio_registry">Apache Avro and Apicurio Registry</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Avro and Apicurio got a lot of attention in the last weeks. First, Clément Escoffier, who already took the time to blog about <a href="">How to Use Kafka, Schema Registry and Avro with Quarkus</a> a few months ago, just released a new article on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/avro-native/">Using Avro in a native executable</a>. Hugo Guerrero also took a stab at the topic in his blog entry on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/12/11/debezium-serialization-with-apache-avro-and-apicurio-registry/">Debezium serialization with Apache Avro and Apicurio Registry</a>.</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p><em>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Today, we’ll focus on some core project of our community. The first one is obviously Wildfly, our Jakarta EE application server whom predecessor (JBoss AS) was the beginning of everything. The second one is our more recent and shiny project, Quarkus. Without any further ado, let’s begin!</em></p><p></p>

<h2 id="_wildfly_a_first_taste_of_jakarta_9">Wildfly, a first Taste of Jakarta 9</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the release of the <a href="https://wildfly.org//news/2020/11/19/WildFly2101-Released/">Wildfly 21.01</a>, it’s time to put the Jakarta EE server back in the spotlight. Especially as this release gives a <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2020/11/12/Jakarta-EE-9-with-WildFly-Preview/">a preview of Jakarta EE 9</a>! And if your knowledge of the EE standards needs a refresher to fully enjoy this preview, we got you covered with this in depth two-part series on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">Jakarta EE multitenancy (part1)</a> and <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/12/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-2/">(part 2)</a>.</p>
<p>But Jakarta EE 9 is not the only newsworthy item around Wildfly.

<h2 id="_quarkus_leading_the_future_of_java">Quarkus, Leading the Future of Java</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It might a bold statement, but we’ve made it! Or rather Red Hat made it as Quarkus 1.7 is available as a product for a little while now. Maybe it’s time to finally take a look at it by following this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/10/leading-the-future-of-java-with-the-red-hat-build-of-quarkus-1-7/">Red Hat Quarkus tutorial</a>?</p>
<p>This is also a perfect opportunity to explore Quarkus functionality and ecosystems. For instance, take a look at this interesting post on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-invoke-and-call/">mutiny invoke and call</a>. Or simply explore the cloud readiness of the framework with this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/13/how-i-built-a-serverless-blog-search-with-java-quarkus-and-aws-lambda/">building a serverless blog search with Quarkus and AWS lambda</a> and this <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-quarkus-red-hat-openshift?sc_cid=701f2000000tyBjAAI">introduction to Quarkus on Red Hat Openshift</a>?</p>

<p>If Quarkus and Wildfly did not quench your thirst for knowledge, let us give you a bit more nuggets. First, why not explore the topic of <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/09/openid-connect-integration-with-red-hat-3scale-api-management-and-okta/">using OpenID connect integration with 3scale</a>? Or maybe <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2020/11/contract-first-development-event-driven.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FhFXzh+%28Christina+%E7%9A%84+J%E8%80%81%E9%97%86%29">contract first development using an event-driven approach with Kafka, AMQ Streams, APIcurio</a>? And to make it extra spicy, Christina has even a added a touch of Google protobuf! By the way, if "event driven" is your thing, you can then move this other article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/17/event-driven-serverless-applications-with-camel-k/">event driven serverless with Camel K</a>.</p>
<p>Still hungry for more? Well, maybe it’s time for less crunchy and technical details? What about stepping back and invite some reflection on <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2020/11/open-source-monetization-ecosystem.html">Open Source monetization ecosystem</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 30 September 2020</h1>
      <p>It’s that time again where we round up the latest news from the community…</p>
<p>Are you looking to develop projects on your local machine, and push them on to a real OpenShift Container Platform, without having to worry about cloud hosting of your container platform?
In this <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/how-to-setup-openshift-container-platform-45.html">post</a> Eric Schabell provides an easy way to get up and running with CodeReady containers on your own development machine.
He’s automated most of the process through scripts, and guides you through the rest of the process.
Eric also shows you how to drop into the Developer console in OCP providing a developer focused view that hides much of the plumbing that is not needed during development.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/call-an-existing-rest-service-with-apache-camel-k/">post</a> Mary Cochran shows us a simple way to connect existing services together using CamelK via each service’s REST APIs.
Mary gets deep into the details providing code examples and commands to get you up and running.</p>
<p>Eric Schabell continues his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">blog series</a>, bringing you architectural blueprints for&nbsp;cloud-native financial payment services.
The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.
This week he covers the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-common-elements.html">Common Architecture Elements</a> that make up the architecture, and gets into some details with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-immediate-payments-example.html">Immediate Payments Example</a>.</p>
<p>As is normal for this time of year, the conference season is beginning to kick off.
Albeit this year in a virtual arena.
Undoubtedly this is an unfortunate situation for those that enjoy the in-person events.
However, it’s great for accessibility and reach allowing many more people across to globe to attend.
DevConf.US 2020 is one such event.
It’s a free, Red Hat sponsored technology conference for community project and professional contributors to Free and Open Source technologies.
Read more <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/devconfus-2020-appdev-containerization-ask-the-experts.html">here</a> where Eric describes the “AppDev &amp; Containerization Ask the Experts” Panels that he and Kurt Stam  will be moderating.</p>
<p>This week Kapil Shukla explains how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/build-a-data-streaming-pipeline-using-kafka-streams-and-quarkus/">build a data streaming pipeline using Kafka Streams and Quarkus</a>.
In this post Kapil shows how data can be processed in real-time as and when it arrives, instead of being batch processed as was needed in the past.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/22/troubleshooting-user-task-errors-in-red-hat-process-automation-manager-and-red-hat-jboss-bpm-suite/">Post</a> Anton Giertli provides help with troubleshooting user task errors in Red Hat Process Automation Manager and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.
If you are a developer working with user tasks and having trouble debugging them, this post might well help you out.</p>
<p>With the recent release of Apache Camel VS Code extension (0.0.27) comes several new language support features for Apache Camel.

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 16 September 2020</h1>
      <p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p>
<p>Our very own Mark Little goes into detail to explain Quarkus and Jakarta EE compatibility. Mark gives an insightful breakdown of the history for both projects and answers a much asked question, will Quarkus and Jarkata EE come together? No spoilers here, though. Go read Mark’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/11/quarkus-and-jakarta-ee-together-or-not/">Quarkus and Jakarta EE: Together, or not?</a> if you already haven’t.</p>
<p>In the evangelist’s corner, Eric Schabell has brought out an excellent <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/beginners-guide-to-decision-management-retail-web-shop.html">hands-on workshop with labs</a> for Red Hat Decision Manager that show you how to design and build a retail web shop from scratch.</p>
<p>Eric also teams up with Ramon Villarreal to bring you architectural blueprints for <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">cloud-native financial payment services</a>. The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.</p>
<p>Leon Matthews continues the topic of all things financial with his analysis of the history of Java in the banking sector and the role Quarkus is playing in allowing banks and financial institutions to embrace change, innovate to remain competitive, and become more efficient. Read Leon’s post: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/25-years-and-going-strong-why-java-matters-future-banks?source=bloglisting">25 years and going strong: Why Java matters to the future of banks</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Quarkus, Clement Escoffier shows you how to build a stream of beer and then retrieve beers in a reactive way. After walking you through how you can do that with Mutiny, Clement provides a gist with all the code that you can compile and execute with jbang and a single command. You can find everything in his <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-pagination/">Handling paginated APIs with Mutiny</a> post.</p>
<p>Another post from the Quarkus team that is worth reading is Jeff Beck’s <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/wipro-customer-story/">Wipro Addresses Seismic Shift in Retail with Quarkus</a>. Jeff shares the Wipro story by describing their needs and challenges and how they adopted Quarkus to modernize their applications and address customer use cases.</p>
<p>If it hasn’t crossed your radar, Bela Ban shows us his plans for a <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/09/one-size-fits-all-jgroups.html">One Size Fits All JGroups</a> program and explains what is needed to get there.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team shares a post that looks at using the <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/09/01/enforce-custom-resource-policies-with-opa-gatekeeper/">Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper project to enforce policies when creating custom resources</a> and demonstrates how this is useful. While the post focuses on Strimzi, Jakub points out how Gatekeeper can be used with other projects so go take a look.</p>
<p>Releases!!</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Infinispan team for releasing the Dev03 cut of Infinispan 12. Cross-site replication capabilities continue to advance with an SPI that includes configurable policies for merging conflicting values from asynchronous backups, a feature which guarantees data consistency between global Infinispan clusters. That’s no small feat of engineering! Find out about that and more over on the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/09/08/infinispan-12/">Infinispan blog</a>.</p>
<p>Quarkus 1.8 is out with some shiny new features, including jbang integration for easy Quarkus-based scripting, support for multiple persistence units for the Hibernate ORM extension, a new Micrometer extension, and update to GraalVM 20.2 for building native apps from Quarkus projects. Here is the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-8-0-final-released/">announcement with all the info</a>.</p>
<p>Keycloak have announced their new Account Console, built on React and PatternFly 4. The latest version offers a fresher look and feel with custom themes and extensions. Go <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2020/09/new-account-console.adoc">check it out</a>.</p>

      <h1>JBoss Weekly Editorial 27 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Weekly Editorial!
Summer is drawing to a close, but that doesn’t mean Red Hat has been resting, or that nothing has been happening over the past two weeks.
There’s been some great movement and progress made, which we’ll cover.
In this edition we’re going to focus on OpenShift, the blogosphere, and finally, other project news.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_openshift">OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Last week was KubeCon Europe 2020, which as you can guess, was a big event for OpenShift!
We had 15 speakers from Red Hat speaking over the three days, giving 17 talks.
A number of new announcements, blog posts, and articles came out during KubeCon Europe 2020, They’re all liked at <a href="https://www.openshift.com/kubecon">the OpenShift event page</a>.
There’s simply too many to link here.
The above event page has videos, press release links, links to other announcements and blogs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blogs">Blogs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Continuing the trend about OpenShift, Paul Vergilis wrote about external clients and Red Hat AMQ over at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/26/connecting-external-clients-to-red-hat-amq-broker-on-red-hat-openshift/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
If you’re interested in getting started with Strimzi, Apache Kafka on Kubernetes, you’ll want to catch up on the blog post Paolo Patierno and Jakub Scholz wrote: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/14/introduction-to-strimzi-apache-kafka-on-kubernetes-kubecon-europe-2020/">Introduction to Strimzi: Apache Kafka on Kubernetes (KubeCon Europe 2020)</a>.
For those of you running OpenJDK 8, you’ll want to know more about JDK Flight Recorder available in OpenJDK 8u262. An indepth intro is available at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/25/get-started-with-jdk-flight-recorder-in-openjdk-8u/">Red Hat Developer Blog</a> written by Mario Torre.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_projects">Projects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>To wrap up this edition, we will be looking at two announcements from Keycloak:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2020/08/keycloak-1101-released.html">Keycloak 11.0.1 released</a> - fixing seven bugs</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 13 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_5">JGroups 5!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Exciting news from Bela Ban as <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/08/jgroups-500final-released.html">JGroups 5.0.0.Final</a> is released. JGroups 5 brings lots of improvements and some major API changes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change is that <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#Message"><code>Message</code></a> is now an interface with a number of subclasses that perform late marshalling so object payload is serialized at the point when messages are sent, which eliminates a memory allocation and makes JGroups performance even better.</p>
<p>Other cool features in JGroups 5 are <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">virtual thread support</a>, an implementation of the Random Early Drop (RED) protocol, more efficient FD_ALL3 failure detection, a new protocol to dump stats, and lots more.</p>
<p>Hearty congratulations to Bela and all the contributors and folks who made it happen!!</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html">JGroups 5 documentation</a> and find out more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_keycloak_tech_talk">Keycloak Tech Talk</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Stian Thorgersen of the Keycloak team presents a DevNation Tech Talk that provides an in-depth look at the best open-source identity and management solution around. Stian gives a great demo of Keycloak that not only highlights features but showcases just how easy it is to integrate and use Keycloak capabilities to secure your applications.</p>
<p>Spend half an hour and let Stian dazzle you with <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/07/a-deep-dive-into-keycloak/">A deep dive into Keycloak</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reactive_quarkus_a_java_mutiny">Reactive Quarkus: A Java Mutiny</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Another Tech Talk that you should definitely check out comes from Clement Escoffier and Edson Yanaga, who go into detail about Mutiny, a new reactive programming library. Clement and Edson explain why reactive matters, how Mutiny is makes it easier to develop reactive applications, and how the library is integrated with Quarkus.</p>
<p>Listen to Clement and Edson deliver their excellent talk, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/07/reactive-quarkus-a-java-mutiny/">Reactive Quarkus: A Java Mutiny</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_skupper_and_the_hybrid_cloud">Skupper and the Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>By now I’m sure you’ve heard of <a href="https://skupper.io/">Skupper</a> but maybe have yet to see it in action. Ted Ross gives a great introduction and live demonstration of Skupper across AWS, GCP, and Azure that shows real-time load balancing and fail-over.</p>
<p>Watch Ted’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/10/kubernetes-and-the-hybrid-cloud-with-skupper/">Kubernetes and the hybrid cloud with Skupper</a> Tech Talk today. You won’t regret it.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_in_the_community">In the Community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Katia Aresti has created a pretty awesome Infinispan Server tutorial that demonstrates a full set of capabilities with a weather application. Visit the <a href="https://infinispan.org/infinispan-server-tutorial/">Infinispan Remote Weather App Tutorial</a> and try it for yourself.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team has written a comprehensive blog post, <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/08/05/using-open-policy-agent-with-strimzi-and-apache-kafka/">Using Open Policy Agent with Strimzi and Apache Kafka</a>, that explores support for Kafka authorization using Open Policy Agent.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 30th July 2020: No rest for the JBoss community!</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! The last two weeks have been pretty rich on published content and releases, so let’s dive right in!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_from_spring_boot_to_quarkus">From Spring Boot to Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As Quarkus community is increasing the question of how to migrate to this new framework (or rather runtime) often arises. If you happen to have such predicament with Spring Boot, I’m sure you’ll be quite interested to read this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/17/migrating-spring-boot-tests-to-quarkus/">migrating Spring Boot tests to Quarkus</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_secure_vue_js_with_keycloak">Secure vue.js with Keycloak</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If most of the content we mentioned today is made of articles, we have one, quite cool video content to share. It’s coming straight from one of the tech-talks of the DevNation and we hope you’ll like it :  <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/secure-vuejs-keycloak">Secure vue.js using Keycloak</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_double_your_performance_with_virtual_threads">JGroups: Double your performance with virtual threads!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quite a lot of exciting things are happening in the realm of JGroups lately! Last time, we already mentioned the <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a>, but Bela Ban, the creator of project, got us even more excited with this news about <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">how one can double its performance using virtual threads (fibers) on JDK15/16</a>!!! This JDK is still a bit down the road, but its certainly a nice glimpse into tomorrow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_back_to_the_basics">Back to the Basics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As said above, the last two weeks have been particularly rich in interesting content around the JBoss community and the Java ecosystem at large. Some of those articles took the time to go back and rethink some aspects of our work that we take for granted. Let’s first mention this original take on java programming that focuses on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/09/behavior-is-easy-state-is-hard-tame-inconsistent-state-in-your-java-code/">taming inconsistent state in a Java code</a>.</p>
<p>This first article is already pretty centered around coding, but this next one goes into the very guts of Infinispan! If you know the project, I’m sure you’ll find this entry on <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/22/anchored-keys/">anchored keys</a> as fascinating as I did!</p>
<p>Let’s also revisit a classic: load balancing a JEE app server (such as Wildfly or its product counterpart JBoss EAP), but with a twist: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/15/load-balancing-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-subclusters-with-mod_cluster/">Load balancing Red Hat JBoss EAP with subclusters</a>.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_evangelists_corner">Evangelist’s Corner</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>No rest for the wicked! And no, no rest for our very own Eric D. Schabell! In the last two weeks, he has been quite busy again. First of all, he got his very <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/what-the-dev-podcast-episode-44-agile-integration.html">first interview on a podcast</a> (yep, that’s right, he was never on a podcast before!). With the host, he discussed the best practices for Agile integration. If you are interested in this topic, fetch the episode, you won’t regret it!</p>
<p>That’s not all. Eric also took the time to update and release his "fully updated to the latest release" version of his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/beginners-guide-building-a-retail-web-shop-workshop-update.html">Beginners guide - Building a retail web shop workshop update</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, he took the time to describe <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/how-to-install-rhpam-77.html">how to How to Install Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.7</a> and share his experience with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/shift-remote-2020-devops-heroes.html">Shift Remote 2020 online conference</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases_releases_releases">Releases, releases, releases,…​</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As always, the JBoss community has been pretty busy in the last weeks and a few projects have seized the relative quietness of Summer to release new version of their product:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2020/07/keycloak-1100-released.html">Keycloak 11.0.0</a></p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_decaf">Decaf</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>For once, this section stays rather close to Java, covering how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/27/deploy-your-java-web-application-into-the-cloud-using-eclipse-jkube/">deploy your Java Webapp into the cloud using Eclipse JKube</a>. So, yes, we’ll talk Kubernetes, but in a context quite close to home :) .</p>
<p>That’s all for another edition of the JBoss Editorial, please join us again for more exciting development from the JBoss Communities.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 9 July 2020: Over the (j)cliff!</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Summer has begun, well, at least for those of you readers living in the northern hemisphere :)! So let’s enjoy it by giving some nice, interesting and exciting reading material to enjoy while resting in the sun (with your mask, #staysafe!).</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_infinispan_11">Infinispan 11!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s out! The new major version of Infinispan is here! Please go and check out <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/03/infinispan-11/">Infinispan 11</a>!</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_new_netty_transport">JGroups: new Netty transport!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’ve said it many times, JGroups is an incredible piece of software. The power and the flexibility of the frameworks always dazzle me, so I’m very excited about this <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a> getting into it!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_ansible_collection_for_jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s a pet project of mine that I have already mentioned a few months ago: Andrew Block, Roel Holzmans and I have been working on integrating further Widlfy (and EAP) into Ansible, in order to ensure that one can use the tool to fine-tune as much as possible the JEE server’s configuration. We leverage an existing Open Source Java tool called <a href="https://github.com/bserdar/jcliff">JCliff</a> to just that.</p>
<p>Last year, we released a role, already available in <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat-cop/jcliff">Ansible Galaxy</a>, to integrate JCliff into Ansible. However, since then, the Ansible community released a new format to distribute extension, called Ansible Collection. We therefore decide to migrate our content there and we finally released, just this week, a very first version: <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat/jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff 0.0.1</a>.</p>
<p>So, please check it out! All you need to do is $ ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.jcliff:0.0.1 and, voilà, the collection is installed and you can start to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/ansible_collections_jcliff_demo">play with it</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot! This release also supports, on tops of Linux, MacOSX with homebrew! (Windows using Chocolatey is coming next).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_serverless_and_microservice">Serverless and Microservice</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As alluring as “serverless” is, it does, like any other technology, come with its own challenges. Follow Christina as she goes through the importance of having the proper infrastructure to support your “serverless” apps in this well thought out blog entry: <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2020/07/serverless-integration-components.html">Serverless Integration Components</a></p>
<p>Follow this first read, you may want to take a look at this other article on <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2020/07/operators-and-sidecars-are-new-model.html">operators and sidecars are the new model</a>, which also discuss similar concerns.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_microprofile">Microprofile</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the release JBoss EAP XP, there are a lot of opportunities to develop supported microprofile application. So if you want to explore how to develop such an application, please follow <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/author/ehugonne/">Emmanuel Hugonnet</a>’s tutorial on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/01/develop-eclipse-microprofile-applications-on-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-with-red-hat-codeready-workspaces/">Develop Eclipse MicroProfile applications on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0 with Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_decafquarkus_workshops_automated_with_ansible">Decaf—Quarkus Workshops automated with Ansible</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Yeah, I know, we just talked about Ansible! Where is my Java stuff you are rightly asking. Well, as you’ll see Ansible, while being Python, plays well with Java software, as demonstrated by this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/03/automate-workshop-setup-with-ansible-playbooks-and-codeready-workspaces/">automate workshop setup with Ansible playbooks and CodeReady workspaces</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 26 June 2020</h1>
      <p>Here we are, once again at the close of June.
Another summer has begun, albeit a little different than most.
I hope everyone is safe, healthy, and doing well.
There have been some very interesting blogs posted in the past couple of weeks that we’ll discuss in this edition, as well as a few releases.</p>
<p>Operators in Kubernetes provide an extension point for the platform.
They follow a pattern allowing you to manage resources and applications within the cluster.
An operator can be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped.
Did you know, however, that you can convert between the two?
That is exactly what Abhishek Koserwal details in six steps over on the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/26/migrating-a-namespace-scoped-operator-to-a-cluster-scoped-operator/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Abhishek walks you through a basic example and provides the full example as a GitHub repo.
Read the article for more information, and reasons why you may want or need to switch between the different scopes.</p>
<p>Multitenancy may be something you deal with everyday, or it may be something you’re looking at adding to your current application base.
Either way, dealing with persistence can be tricky.
Tenants must not see each other’s data, but be allowed to operate simultaneously.
Your application must also perform well while still being easy to maintain.
Rhuan Rocha has started a two part series on how to use JPA with Multitenancy over on the Red Hat Developer blog.
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">The first entry</a> details the problem and presents a possible solution using WildFly and EJBs.
Expect the next installment to look more at Hibernate and JPA solutions.</p>
<p>Effortlessly building a native application is of course, one of the amazing capabilities of Quarkus.
However, when it comes to debugging, a native Quarkus application makes debugging <strong>very</strong> difficult.
A large part of this is the optimizations that happen to create that quick, small, native binary.
This debugging complication hasn’t gone unnoticed.
Andrew Dinn has been working on this problem.
He contributed a solution where the debug information is embedded with in the native image and can be access with <code>gdb</code>.
If you’d like to learn more about the solution, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/debugging-graalvm-native-images-using-gdb/">read Andrew’s blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing with the Quarkus theme, Durgesh Anaokar wrote about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/19/develop-and-test-a-quarkus-client-on-red-hat-codeready-containers-with-red-hat-data-grid-8-0/">developing and testing a Quarkus Red Hat Data Grid client using Red Hat CodeReady Containers</a>.
Durgesh details installing CRC (Red Hat Code Ready Containers) and Data Grid on OpenShift 4 as well as running the client.
Naturally, his project code is hosted in GitHub, you’ll find that link in his blog entry.</p>
<p>Red Hat now has images, Universal Base Images to be exact, of OpenJDK (8 and 11) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2.
A Universal Base Image (UBI) is an OCI-compliant container base OS image with runtime and language support that can be used as the base for Docker images and Podman/Buildah images.
These will allow you to deploy and build supportable applications on Red Hat OpenShift and RHEL.
It also includes a number of additional user-space packages over a base UBI.
Read more about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/introducing-the-red-hat-build-of-the-openjdk-universal-base-images-now-in-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-2/">over at Red Hat Developers</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been following, you’ll know the Infinispan team has been hard at work on Infinispan 11.
They are proud to announce that <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/15/infinispan-11/">Inifinspan 11.0.0. Final has been released</a>!
A number of improvements and features have been added to this release including clustering, CLI, Hot Rod Client improvements, non-blocking internals, and others.</p>
<p>Along with that new Infinispan release, you can now deploy a <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/16/native-server-announce/">natively compiled version of the Infinispan server</a>!
The memory footprint is only 286MB.
There are also native Quarkus extensions for your Quarkus based applications.</p>
<p>Not to be left out of the cloud native party, Apache Camel is <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/18/camel-k-1-0-the-serverless-integration-platform-goes-ga/">announcing the GA release of Apache Camel K 1.0</a>.
This release includes tooling, connectors, and integrations with Knative.
This is a great step forward for doing integrations with a small footprint.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/17/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-released/">Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0</a> was recently released.
This is a patch that adds MicroProfile capabilities to JBoss EAP.
There are some policy changes you will need to be aware of, but you find links to all of thosewithin the announcement.</p>
<p>Thanks again for being with us on another JBoss Editorial!</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>We’re a little light on the news this time, but those of us who have been reading the editorial for a few years will be familiar with the "after Summit slump."
With Red Hat Summit behind us (and what a great Summit, check out the sessions on demand if you missed them), many people have taken PTO.
Expect all the news, blogs, releases, etc. to pick back up in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>All that being said, we do have some blogs to go over and one release.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blogs">Blogs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>First up is Eric Schabell’s second entry in his "Demystifying the Event Driven Architecture - Making the case" series.
You can read more about it <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/05/demystifying-event-driven-architecture-making-the-case.html">at his blog</a>.</p>
<p>We have another post by Eric: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/05/code-ready-containers-installing-hr-employee-rewards-project.html">Code Ready Containers - Installing an HR employee rewards project using developer container catalog</a>.

<h2 id="_2020_04_30_the_virtual_red_hat_summit_week">[2020-04-30] - The Virtual Red Hat Summit week</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’m writing this as we wrap up another successful Red Hat Summit.
But this year, with a significant distinction: the event was 100%
virtual. Despite the involuntary move to virtual, there were many
benefits that came about from the change in format. The event was
completely free, and of course required no travel, allowing a much
broader and more diverse set of attendees to benefit from the
content and experience. It was also ran in three regions to
accommodate many more timezones.</p>
<p>Being Red Hat we were keen to experiment with the format and find
new ways to engage with the community. It was important for us to
carry over as much of the personality and intimacy of the physical
event as possible. So, this needed to be more than just a bunch of
streamed talks. The talks were pre-recorded which allowed the
presenter(s) to participate directly in the Q&amp;A in real-time
as the talk proceeded. There was also a variety of sessions that
went beyond the talk format. For examples see
<em>Ask the experts</em>, <em>Networking social hour</em>, and
the <em>Virtual Open Neighborhood</em> on the
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/agenda/agenda-at-a-glance">agenda</a>.</p>
<p>If you weren’t able to attend, or want to catch some of the
talks you missed, you can <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/QReg.htm?ShowUUID=4245E6E3-7D25-496D-9B08-4CBDC87CCE74">re-live the virtual event here</a>.</p>
